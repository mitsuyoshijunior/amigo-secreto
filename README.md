# Secret Santa Draw

This is a learning project that consists of a simple drawing application. Here’s how it works:

1. Add the names of the people participating in the Secret Santa (minimum of 4);  
2. Click the 'Draw' button;  
3. The application will assign a person to each participant, indicated by an arrow.

That’s it! A quick and easy draw.
